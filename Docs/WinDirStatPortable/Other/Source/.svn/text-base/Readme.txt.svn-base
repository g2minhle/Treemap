About WinDirStat Portable
=========================
The WinDirStat Portable Launcher allows you to run WinDirStat from a removable drive whose letter changes as you move it to another computer.  The program can be entirely self-contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.


License
=======
This code is released under the GPL.  The full code is included with this package as WinDirStatPortable.nsi.


Installation / Directory Structure
==================================
By default, the program expects this directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with WinDirStatPortable.exe
	+\App\
		+\WinDirStat\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\

It can be used in other directory configurations by including the WinDirStatPortable.ini file in the same directory as WinDirStatPortable.exe and configuring it as details in the INI file section below.


WinDirStatPortable.ini Configuration
====================================
The WinDirStat Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called WinDirStatPortable.ini (read the previous section for details on placement).  If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  The INI file is formatted as follows:

[WinDirStatPortable]
AdditionalParameters=
DisableSplashScreen=false

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline parameter entries to WinDirStat.exe.  Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to WinDirStat.exe.

The DisableSplashScreen entry allows you to run the WinDirStat Portable Launcher without the splash screen showing up.  The default is false.
